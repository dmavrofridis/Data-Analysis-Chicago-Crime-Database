# Instructions:

Thank you for reading this.

In order to ensure that our code runs flawlessly on your side, it would 
be best if you would carefully follow the next steps.

Before you continue please be aware that checkpoint 1 was completed 
using JetBrain's Datagrip through a valid connection to the CPDP database.

## Prerequisites
- Please make sure to download and install Datagrip on your machine.
- Set up the connection to the CPDP database in Datagrip by inserting new data source from URL and following the steps that are posted on Canvas.

## Next steps:
- After setting up the connection, you can run each one of the queries either by copy pasting them into the terminal or by directly opening the sql files from the project folder.
- You can also find the relevant code by clicking on the hyperlinks under each question below.
- For each block of code that you run, you are going to be served with the appropriate results.
