# Instructions:

Thank you for reading this.

For the interactive visualization part of this project, we are going to be using the D3 javascript library in ObservableHQ, to generate interactive and easy to understand visualizations and models.

In order to ensure that you won't encounter any problems or errors 
while opening the D3 ObservableHQ files on your computer please make sure to
carefully read the next steps.

Before you continue please be aware that checkpoint 3 was completed using D3 and ObservableHQ for the interactive visualization of the data after creating the necessary SQL queries as to retrieve and upload the final csv files required for the interactive figures to work on ObservableHQ.

## Prerequisites
- All you need is an active internet connection and preferably use a web broswer like Safari or Google Chrome to access ObservableHQ.

## Next steps:
- Simply click on each one of the following links under each figure in order to access them.

## Results & Analysis:
Please make sure to read the findings report in order to completely understand the results for each one of the figures below.

## Figure 1:
#### Create a sunburst to show the progressions of TRR incidents. For example, what is the most likely course of events if a perpetrator spits on a police officer?
