Thank you for reading this.

For the interactive visualization part of this project, we are going to be using the D3 javascript library in Observable, in order to generate interactive and easy to understand visualizations and models.

In order to ensure that you won't encounter any problems or errors 
while opening the D3 Observable files on your computer please make sure to

Before you continue please be aware that checkpoint 3 was completed 
using D3 and Observable for the interactive visualization of the data after establishing an active and valid 
connection to the CPDP database.
