Project Proposal for 10/04/2021: INITIAL PROPOSAL
Can police officers be grouped together based on the allegations made against them?
If so, what are the most common traits that characterize each group?
Do the identified groups show similarities in the types of misconduct and allegations made against them?

Project Proposal (The Exalted Spartans)
Hi everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this:)
By working with data provided by the Invisible Institute's Citizen's Police Data Project,
we aspire to identify different groups of police officers that share similar traits and
characteristics based on the allegations made against them.
Additionally, after the grouping of the police officers is complete, we will explore
the connections between certain police officer groups and the allegations they receive.
As a result, we will be able to understand the connection between the severity of the reported allegations and the police officer's behavior.
Finally, we will draw our conclusion by identifying patterns and similarities in the allegations made against certain
police officer groups and whether these groups tend to repeat certain types of misconducts and how those patterns have changed over time.
By implementing an NLP model as well as ML algorithms we will quantify the severity of allegation types while grouping them
accordingly. Thus, our algorithm will generate the information required for us to further understand whether some of the 
identified police groups are connected to similar alegation types. By implementing the NLP algorithm and using the detailed reports and
complaints available in CPDP, we will be also attempting to establish a connection between allegation severity in certain police groups and how 
it may have changed over time.
