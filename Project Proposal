Project Proposal for 10/04/2021: INITIAL PROPOSAL
Can police officers be grouped together based on the allegations made against them?
If so, what are the most common traits that characterize each group?
Do the identified groups show similarities in the types of misconduct and allegations made against them?

Project Proposal (The Exalted Spartans):

Hi everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this:)

By working with data provided by the Invisible Institute's Citizen's Police Data Project, 
we aspire to identify different groups of police officers that share similar traits and characteristics
based on the allegations made against them. Additionally, after the grouping of the police officers is complete,
we will explore the connections between certain police officer groups and the allegations they receive.
As a result, we will be able to understand the connection between the severity of the reported allegations
and the police officer's behavior. Furthermore, we will draw our conclusion by identifying patterns 
and similarities in the allegations made against certain police officer groups and whether they tend to repeat
certain types of misconduct. Finally, we'll determine how those patterns have changed over time. 
By implementing an NLP model as well as ML algorithms we will quantify the severity 
of allegation types while grouping them accordingly.
Thus, our algorithm will generate the information required, in order to allow us to further understand whether
some of the identified police groups are connected via similar allegation types.
