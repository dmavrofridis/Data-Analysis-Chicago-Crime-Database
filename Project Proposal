Project Proposal for 10/04/2021: INITIAL PROPOSAL
Can police officers be grouped together based on the allegations made against them?
If so, what are the most common traits that characterize each group?
Do the identified groups show similarities in the types of misconduct and allegations made against them?

Project Proposal for 10/04/2021 DIMITRIS
Hi everyone and thank you for taking the time to read this:)
By working with data provided by the Invisible Institute's Citizen's Police Data Project,
we aspire to identify different groups of police officers that share similar traits and
characteristics based on the allegations made against them.
Additionally, after the grouping of the police officers is complete, we will explore
the connections between certain police officer groups and the allegations they receive.
As a result, we will be able to understand the connection between the severity of the reported allegations and the police officer's behavior.
Finally, we will draw our conclusion by identifying patterns and similarities in the allegations made against certain
police officer groups and whether these groups tend to repeat certain types of allegations and how those patterns have changed over time.


Methodology for 10/04/2021
In the proposal we will understand how the allegations types have changed with type,
how severe or less severe they are becoming with the time and whether certain groups of police officers
tend to behave in a certain way towards certain groups of people. By doing so we will understand the connection 
between the severity of allegations and police behavior and based on that we will draw the conclusion whether police 
officers tend to misbehave more frequently over time and because of them allegations against are becoming less severe or more severe
