# Instructions:

Thank you for reading this.

In order to ensure that you won't encounter any problems or errors 
while opening the Tableau files on your computer please make sure to
carefully read the next steps.

Before you continue please be aware that checkpoint 2 was completed 
using JetBrain's Datagrip and Tableau for the visualization of the data after establishing an active and valid 
connection to the CPDP database.

## Prerequisites
- Please make sure to download and install Tableau on your machine while also activating the free trial or the student/teacher 1 year free version.
- Set up the connection to the CPDP database in Tableau using PostgreSQL by following the steps that are posted on Canvas.

## Next steps:
- After setting up the connection, you can run each one of the files by opening them up using the Tableau user interface. 
- You may be prompted to enter the CPDP connection password in order to gain access to the visualizations.
- You may encounter an error about custom SQL code being used, if so please select "yes" from the given options.
- If you receive a message about "extract not found", please choose the "regenerate the extract" option and store the new file somewhere convenient.
- By opening up each file from the src folder, you are going to be served with the appropriate visual results.

## Results & Analysis:
